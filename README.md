Made some roblox VFX for homelander inspired games, contains non family friendly probably pg13 stuff but im sure its fine
In-game there are module scripts (i hope they are still there) containing instructions, information, and tips
Its just VFX so there are no actual scripts there that do anything. its just the VFX
