Made some roblox VFX that is basically homelander related, because this is inspired by The boys there are blood related stuff in-game, you can remove these.
In-game there are module scripts containing instructions, information, and tips.
Its just VFX so there are no actual scripts there that do anything. its just the VFX.
i have no idea what good thing to say here so imagine a long README.md
